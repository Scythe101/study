# Conditional Statements

In Spanish, to express what could happen, given another event happening, you can use "Si". If conditionals can be used to express a range of likelihoods, ranging from a 50% chance of happening to a 0% chance of happening.

## 1. Possible/Likely Situations (50%)

Use indicative, and never use subjunctive

1. Si + present + present
- Si quieres, podemos ir.
- If you want, we can go.
<br><br>
2. Si + present + future
- Si puedo, iré contigo.
- If I can, I'll go with you.
<br><br>
3. Si + present + imperative
- Si necesitas ayuda, llámame.
- If you need help, call me.

## 2. Unlikely Situations (1%)

Use subjunctive, as they are not certain or likely

Si + Imperfect subjunctive + Conditional
- Si estudiaran, estarían listo para el examen.
- If they studied, they would be ready for the test.

## 3. Impossible Situations (0%)

Use pluperfect subjunctive because they express situations that *could have happened* in the past.

Si + Pluperfect Subjunctive + Conditional Perfect
- Si hubiera estudiado, habría aprobado el examen.
- If I had studied, I would have passed the test.
